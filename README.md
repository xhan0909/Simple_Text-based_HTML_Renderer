# Simple Text-based HTML Renderer

This is a very simple text-based HTML Renderer which currently only supports \<p\> and necessary \<table\> elements (\<tr\> and \<td\>), and maybe some css for controlling spacing and table sizing (currently only support `width`, either in `%` format or in `ch` format).

The program should take in an HTML file and render text as output in ASCII style.

**Run:**  
`$python main.py -f [html file path]`
